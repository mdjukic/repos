git checkout sets your HEAD, a pointer to the current working Branching

- Create a Branch
git branch fix20
git checkout fix20

alternatively, we can do this in one step, run:
git checkout -b fix20

-edit .gitignore file, say

-switch over to master branch, run:
git checkout master

- push change to master branch, run:
git push db fix20

go to github, branch dbananas, and it should show 2 branches on tab

- if you would want to get the fix20 branch, run:
git checkout -b fix20 db/fix20  
NOTE: I have renamed origin to db, in previous lesson
otherwise, we would use:
git checkout -b fix20 origin/fix20

- To see all branches, run:
git branch
  fix20
* master
NOTE: this shows that we are pointing to the master branch.

- To see all of the merged branches:
git branch --merged
