#Ag Grid Implementation Options
 

 
##'Normal'/Enterprise
 
###Pros
 
* Support for all ag grid features - Enterprise slice and dice
* Server side pagination possible with Infinite scroll
* Quicker initial page of results
 
###Cons
 
* More complicated implementation - need to handle all update callbacks 'manually'.
* Slower fetching next page
* Not very suited to the ngrx pattern we currently use, need to force observables to behave like promises.
* State of grid not held in ngrx
 
##Transactional/Bulk
 
###Pros
 
* Simpler Implementation
* Faster - instant - fetching next page
* Uses technologies we are already using with angular 2 - ngrx
* Fire and forget updates - Automatic grid sync
* State of grid held in ngrx
 
###Cons
 
* Slower initial page of results
* No server side pagination - Large initial load
* No Enterprise slice and dice - User
 
## User experience difference
 
### 'Normal'/Enterprise
 
* Quicker initial page of results
* Slower fetching next page
* Slower performance post initial load
 
### Transactional/Bulk
 
* Slower initial page of results
* No 'next page' required, as all data loaded.
* Better performance post initial load
  
## The filtering question - Client vs Server
 
 
### Server side
 
####Pros
 
* Probable performance benefits on complex sorts - aggregation, multi column
* Possibly more future proof depending on filter requirements.
 
####Cons
 
* Development effort required to implement each additional column
* High network traffic - 10,000 rows is 1mb of data for every sort/filter
  
###Client side
 
####Pros
 
* No development effort for additional columns
* Performance benefits - ag grid sorts 100,000 rows in 1 second.
* No network traffic
 
####Cons
 
* Likely slower on complex sorts - aggregation, multi column
 
 
### User experience difference
 
####Server side
 
* Slower
* Probably faster complex filters on large datasets
* Large datasets require fast internet connection
 
####Client side
 
* Faster for 'usual' filters
 
# Recommendations
 
For the moment, and the initial release, the ag grid bulk upload and client side sort/filter provides the required functionality with the lease effort to get there.
 

 
# Moving Forward
 
 
What needs to be done to move to the rxjs model/ client side filtering?
 
## Front end

- Refactor the UI code to request data in its entirety - not per page
- Refactor the updates to update the ngrx state and not the grid state
- Refactor the UI code to use the in built sort/filter - might need to write a custom date filter
 
##Back end
 
- Default /scenarios and /recommendations should return all by default â€“ currently 50 rows returned
- Accept/Reject All should wait until it has completed
- Accept/Reject All should return all records
