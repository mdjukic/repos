##Demo Path

* I navigate to the scenario summary page and can sort and filter any column using all operators
* I navigate to the workspace and can sort and filter any column using all operators
* I upload all dimension files using SFTP, I wait few minutes and can check the data is into the Redshift database
* I create a new scenario, upload a product selection file and verify the scenario ran using my selection
* \<how do we verify the decay min/max?>
* \<how do we verify excluding products by minimum cover?>
* I go through our plan for the security model implementation
* I go through our plan for the recommendation revision

###Application Security Model Definition

###Sorting & Filtering

No API changes are anticipated for this sprint. The sorting & filtering work in Sprint 3 is the follow-up work from Sprint 2.

###Recommendation Revision Definition


###Product Selection File Upload
With this first need for a file upload through our website interface, we need to agree on a robust and scallable design for file upload throughout the application.

We outlined our discussion and thoughts in the [File Upload Approach](005.file_upload_approach.MD) page.
For this sprint, we will use the EvaporateJS + Signing solution described in the above document.

###Dimension File Load
The product file load was tackled in [Sprint 2](003.sprint_2.MD), for Sprint 3 we are aiming to load all other dimension files:

* Business Hierarchy
* Channel
* Geography
* Product Seasonality
* Statuses
* Excluding Products by Minimum Cover

###Observed Decay Min/Max
####REST API
None: will be hardcoded in the back-end
####DB Model
None: will be hardcoded in the back-end
