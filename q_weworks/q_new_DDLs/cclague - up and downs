ok - at the moment this process isn’t very mature (to put it mildly)
it’s one of the things I’m pushing for so…

RetailAX/RetailAnalytics.DW/DDL

This is where the source code for the db is - add any new tables here with an appropriate sequence number
to add a column, update the existing script
to *really* add a column to an existing table though, do that manually for now - once Darren gets into the build process this will likely change to a series of incremental scripts (something I really don’t want to do) but that’s for next week or maybe the one after
