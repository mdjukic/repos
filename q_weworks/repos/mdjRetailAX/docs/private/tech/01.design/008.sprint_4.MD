# Sprint 4
## Demo Path

* I access the website without being logged in and get redirected to Okta
* I log in with a Deloitte user and access the dashboard
* I create a scenario and run it by clicking on the run button
* I create another scenario and run it directly from the creation screen
* I go into the scenario workspace
* On the workspace I can see totals for my scenario
* I accept and reject recommendation, which impacts the totals
* I click on 'accept all' and all recommendations become accepted
* I can change the content to Bulgarian (is the number/date formatting impacted?)
* I drop files into S3 and check the ETL process, I verify the data is present in redshift

## Description of change

### JWT Token

[User Story 4359](https://deloitteproducts.visualstudio.com/RetailAX/_workitems/edit/4359)

#### Overview

As a product team we want to ensure that our api endpoints are secure. This ticket covers enforcing a token check for every request to the api endpoint.

#### REST API

Authentication middleware will be added to asp.net core api to valididate each request has token which when decoded contains a vaild ogranization id and so on.

The UI should pass a valid JWT token as a OAuth Bearer token for every request to the REST API. The view layer should validate the token, and:

* If the token is invalid it should return a 403 (not authenticated), in which case the API should delegate authentication to the authentication provider (potentially Okta)
* If the token is valid the api should extract the username (email) from the toke and validate the domain is deloitte.co.uk. Any other domain will be considered invalid

At this stage no further validation of the token information will be performed. We will enrich this validation in the next sprint
  
#### REST Data Model

A JWT Token should be passed as a OAuth Bearer token.

Example below:

```
{
  "expiresAt": "2017-03-29T21:42:30.000Z",
  "status": "SUCCESS",
  "sessionToken": "20111DuMTdPoBlMOqX5R_OAV3ku2bTWxP6wUIRT_jqkU6XTvOsJLmDq",
  "_embedded": {
    "user": {
      "id": "00ub0oNGTSWTBKOLGLNR",
      "passwordChanged": "2017-03-29T21:37:25.000Z",
      "profile": {
        "login": "dade.murphy@example.com",
        "firstName": "Dade",
        "lastName": "Murphy",
        "locale": "en_US",
        "timeZone": "America/Los_Angeles"
      }

### Accept All / Reject All Recommendations

[User Story 4367](https://deloitteproducts.visualstudio.com/RetailAX/_workitems/edit/4367) - 
[User Story 4366](https://deloitteproducts.visualstudio.com/RetailAX/_workitems/edit/4366) - 
[User Story 4382](https://deloitteproducts.visualstudio.com/RetailAX/_workitems/edit/4382)

#### Overview

Through the api I can choose to accept all recommendations for a given scenario.

#### UI Changes

We will add an accept all button and provide a loading indicator as the REST API processes the request. Success/Failure will be presented back to the user.

#### REST API

The api endpoint will be:

```
POST /api/scenario/{scenarioId}/recommendation/accept
```

Comments:

* If there was an error a 400 should be returned with an appropriate error message.
* An accept all should not partially succeed.
* If there was a success a 200 should be returned.

Note:

* Due to bandwidth, the reject all back-end support will not be implemented in this sprint

### Localization

[User Story 4255](https://deloitteproducts.visualstudio.com/RetailAX/_workitems/edit/4255) - 
[User Story 4256](https://deloitteproducts.visualstudio.com/RetailAX/_workitems/edit/4256)

#### Overview

As a user I can choose to display the site in Bulgarian. When switching the language to Bulgarian the locale will also be appropriately set.

#### UI Changes

We will utilise ngx-translate to do translations on all static labels and allow a user to toggle between English and Bulgarian. When switching language, the locale settings should also change.

We will add the ability for a user to switch to the user profile dropdown in the header.

We will use translation pipes in already existing ag grid filters.

We will piggyback on the translate service to set/get locale

We will need to create new cell formatters for numbers/dates in ag grid to utilise the angular 2 pipes, and to update existing formaters - i.e. datepicker filter to use pipe.

Comments:

* Use locale id's in ICU format - http://userguide.icu-project.org/locale
* Bulgarian settings for reference - http://www.localeplanet.com/icu/bg-BG/index.html

### Implement Scenario Total Calculations

[User Story 4385](https://deloitteproducts.visualstudio.com/RetailAX/_workitems/edit/4385) - 
[User Story 4384](https://deloitteproducts.visualstudio.com/RetailAX/_workitems/edit/4384)

#### Overview

As a user I can view the total markdown cost within the workspace view. The UI will fetch the latest markdown cost and display at the top of the grid and this figure will be updated as recommendations are accepted and rejected.

There will be no push mechanism between the UI and the back-end yet, the UI will have to implement refresh mechanisms.

#### REST API

New REST endpoint added to support this functionality 

```
GET /api/scenario/{scenarioId}/totals
```
  
#### REST Data Model

```
VmScenarioTotal
{
   "costProductsAll": number,
   "costProductsAccepted": number,
   "productsAcceptedCount": number,
   "productsRejectedCount": number
}
```
  
#### Architecture Changes

No change

#### DB Data Model

Implement the following sums:

* Markdown Cost for all products
* Markdown Cost for all Accepted products
* No. Accepted Products
* No. Rejected Products

### Running Scenario from Scenario List

[User Story 4245](https://deloitteproducts.visualstudio.com/RetailAX/_workitems/edit/4245)

#### Overview

When a user clicks on the scenario run icon, a dialog will appear in the middle of the page, which will allow the user to run the scenario 

Clicking on the row of the given scenario should not trigger running the scenario any more. 

#### UI Changes

Move functionality to run scenario from the row to the cell where the run button lies. 

Move dialog popup downwards so it is more centred. 

Check if status updating is UI or backend issue.

### Running a Scenario from Creation/Edit Screen

[User Story 4246](https://deloitteproducts.visualstudio.com/RetailAX/_workitems/edit/4246)

#### Overview

The scenario must be in a valid state before I can run it, if it is not in a valid state it should show an error message.

On running the scenario the user should get a confirmation message. If the user dismisses the confirmation message he/she will be taken back to the scenario list screen, where the scenario is visible.

#### UI Change

Ensure validation is added for each field.

Add new button to save and run scenario. 

Add functionality to button. 

Add confirmation dialog and add correct routing.

[User Story 4383](https://deloitteproducts.visualstudio.com/RetailAX/_workitems/edit/4383)

#### Overview

A user must be able to view a column checklist from the filter view, and check and uncheck columns.

Unchecking columns will hide them, checking columns will make them visible.

#### UI Changes

Add new checklist section to filter box.

Ensure checklist displays columns correctly.

### Technical Refactoring -- Prediction Logic

[User Story 4371](https://deloitteproducts.visualstudio.com/RetailAX/_workitems/edit/4371)


#### Overview
The prediction logic currently sits in Markdown.Service.CalcService with the following interfaces:

```
      SmCalcRecommendation Calculate(
            ICalculateSettings calculateSettings,
            SmDecayHierarchy decayHierarchy,
            SmElasticityHierarchy elasticityHierarchy,
            SmProduct product,
            SmSchedule schedule,
            SmProductPriceLadder priceLadder,
            decimal?[] pricePath,
            int weekMin,
            int weekMax);
        decimal[][] GenerateLadderPath(SmSchedule schedule, SmProductPriceLadder ladder);
        decimal?[] ExpandLadderPath(int weekMin, int weekMax, decimal[] ladderPath, int[] weeks);
```

This story require better parameterization of these methods in such a way a single price path can determined from data available to the UI at the product result level (ie: limited to data available in the app database and with the recommendation).

* Unit test all covering the existing implementation (n.b. fix ExpandLadderPath bug too)
* Refactor methods to take overriding for
	* Markdown depth
	* Markdown price

### Introduce Revision Concept to Model

[User Story 4370](https://deloitteproducts.visualstudio.com/RetailAX/_workitems/edit/4370)

#### Overview

When markdown prices are calculated, it emits Recommendations, and RecommendationProjections.

There will be n recommendations per product (currently capped at 10), and m projections per recommendation, depending on the number of weeks in the scenario (i.e. 8 week scenario = 8 weeks of data for 1 recommendation).

Only 1 recommendation and 1 set of m projections can be valid at any one time (current this is filtered to where Rank = 1 and Rank is determined by the calculation routine).

When a Recommendation is revised, the recommendations for that specific price path need to be rerun, with overriding Markdown Depths (or prices), ie: instead of a 3 MD price path of 20% 30% 40% at revision 0, this can be revised to 10% 20% 30% at revision 1. 

As a result, rather than filtering the n recommends by just rank, the recommendations need to be filtered by rank = 1 AND ordered by revision id, permitting newer revisions to take precedence.

In the future there might be scope for nominating any 1 recommendation across all the revisions as the chosen one, but at present, this is out of scope.

### Technical Refactoring -- Scenario & Scenario Details

[User Story 4375](https://deloitteproducts.visualstudio.com/RetailAX/_workitems/edit/4375)

#### Overview

To create a Scenario, the current implementation requires a valid Scenario entity. The database enforces Scenario integrity at the column level, and optional columns are only nullable because it is a valid configuration.

As the design matures there are times we require a ScenarioId for related data. For example, in order to upload files to a Scenario, a ScenarioId is required. Unfortunately the ScenarioId can only be returned when all Scenario columns are set.

Instead, the Scenario entity and it's state should be separated into Scenario and ScenarioDetail (plus other Scenario* records as required) permitting additional data, as ScenarioUpload entities, to be saved against the appropriate parent ScenarioId.

The Scenario record should be created transparently as part of the Scenario Configuration process (i.e. where there is no senario id and the underlying data is changed). The FE would push all state changes to the Scenario JSON object. Once it is finalised and ready to be saved as a full ScenarioDetail entity, a new call should be made.

#### REST API

```
/api/scenario/create 
POST
{
	"name": string,
	"json": string,
	"jsonVersion": number
}
RETURNS scenarioId

POST
/api/scenario/update
{

	"hierarchyIds": number[]
	... TBD ...

[User Story 4350](https://deloitteproducts.visualstudio.com/RetailAX/_workitems/edit/4350)

#### Overview
Build the staging tables in Redshift so that we can directly land the data received. This will make it easier to get the E2E working.

Involves scripting and building the following tables and adding to source control:

* stage.business_hierarchy
* stage.channel
* stage.geography
* stage.product
* stage.product_seasonality
* stage.sales
* stage.statuses

Also, for each of the above, produce a json schema describing the load file validation and transformation 

Process to pick up the data from the S3 bucket and load into staging tables.
Will be called by a lambda function triggered on delivery of a relevant file to S3 bucket.

Requirement is for file to be validated using the json schema and then loaded into the corresponding stage... table, ready for transformation to data warehouse table.
